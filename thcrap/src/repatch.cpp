/**
  * This module monitors all patches for external changes to their files, then
  * calls all "repatch" module functions if there have been any.
  *
  * Windows provides various ways to achieve this (see
  * http://qualapps.blogspot.com/2010/05/understanding-readdirectorychangesw.html).
  * Since we want to limit repatching to the files that actually did change,
  * change notifications are not an option. We also can't rely on a window
  * handle, which rules out SHChangeNotifyRegister(). NTFS Change Journals seem
  * to be tied to that specific file system, which alone makes this solution a
  * rather bad idea before even trying it.
  * This only leaves ReadDirectoryChangesW(). We use this function with the
  * I/O completion port strategy to monitor all patch directories using one
  * single port handle.
  *
  * However, that function still has one glaring design flaw: It forces us to
  * use a fixed-size buffer for what should essentially be a variable-size
  * queue. As a result, it is perfectly possible to lose file changes between
  * two calls if the change buffer was too small to hold everything that
  * happened during two calls to the function.
  *
  * Well, this means that we have to write some code around that function to
  * actually use it properly. This implementation uses two separate threads to
  * achieve what seems to be a pretty decent performance.
  *
  * • The "watcher" thread focuses exclusively on monitoring the changes by
  *   repeatedly calling ReadDirectoryChangesW() for all patch directories and
  *   buffering relevant changes in a performant way.
  *   This is *very* important, as we must spend as little time as possible on
  *   one filled buffer.
  *
  * • The separate "collector" thread waits for a fixed amount of time, then
  *   calls mod_func_run("repatch"), passing the current repatch buffer before
  *   flushing it.

/*
*  Note to future testers:
* 
*  Windows has "touch"-like functionality built into the COPY command
*  to update the timestamp of a file without changing the contents. The
*  syntax is like this:
*
*  copy /b "path/to/file"+,,
*
*  Normally the two commas would result in an obvious parsing error,
*  but it is supported as a special case to force touch operation.
*  See here: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130710-00/?p=3843
